This is a README file. If you can see this, then that means you are reading me, which is good. 
# Data Seek: does stuff that /ds doens'tâ„¢ 
by a_farfetched_person (aka sumwun) 

First and foremost, this program is very bad. So if you want to report bugs, suggest features, or ask questions, then try posting that stuff on one of these 3 places:

(before you ask, no, "there's a type that's strong against grass, psychic, and dark" is **NOT** a bug. do **NOT** try to report it)

Of course, if you know how to program, then feel free to download this thing and change it however you want. You might even make it better. I think my worst problem is that reading the txt files takes a long time, so if you can tell me how to make it faster, then that would be great. 

If you like reading (or if you actually want to use this program), then you can try reading otherreadme.md.
